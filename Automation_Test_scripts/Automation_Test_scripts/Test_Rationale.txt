## 1. test_login.py — **Foundation of Access Control**
**Rationale**:
The login process is the first interaction users have with the application, setting the tone for their entire experience. A working login feature is essential for access control, security, and overall usability. Automating this test guarantees that valid credentials consistently allow access, while incorrect logins are blocked. This foundational check provides reliability in the user authentication process and prevents regressions that could lead to users being locked out, making it indispensable in any testing suite.

**Impact**:
- **User Experience**: Validates a smooth entry for users.
- **Business Continuity**: Ensures secure access without interrupting user flows.
- **Security**: Highlights potential vulnerabilities in authentication.

## 2. test_add_to_cart.py — **Core Interaction: Product Selection**
**Rationale**:
Adding items to the cart represents one of the most common and business-critical actions for an e-commerce platform. This test validates that users can select items and view them accurately reflected in their cart, a fundamental aspect of a positive shopping experience. Automating this function not only checks that products are properly tracked but also provides confidence that the site can handle essential user interactions without error.

**Impact**:
- **Revenue Assurance**: Ensures users can actively engage with products.
- **User Trust**: Confirms that selections are accurately recorded, increasing reliability.
- **Scalability**: Establishes a reusable test for core interactions across product pages.

## 3. test_remove_from_cart.py — **Flexibility in Shopping Experience**
**Rationale**:
The ability to remove items from the cart is crucial to flexibility and usability, allowing users to adjust their selections without friction. This test checks that users can freely modify their cart, supporting the typical behavior of revisiting and refining choices before purchase. Automating this feature ensures that users have control over their shopping decisions, which enhances satisfaction and reduces potential frustration points.

**Impact**:
- **User Empowerment**: Provides confidence in seamless cart modification.
- **Reduction in Cart Abandonment**: Reduces frustration, encouraging purchase completion.
- **Reliability**: Builds on cart functionality for more comprehensive cart-related test scenarios.

## 4. test_sort_products.py — **Enhanced Product Discovery**
**Rationale**:
Sorting products is a valuable feature that aids in product discovery, allowing users to filter items based on preferences like price or relevance. By automating this test, we ensure that sorting functions as expected, providing a user-centric experience that meets diverse needs. The test focuses on validating the “Price (low to high)” sort, a common choice, to verify that users receive accurate and expected results.

**Impact**:
- **Enhanced Usability**: Supports users in efficiently navigating the product catalog.
- **Increased Conversions**: Helps users find desired products quickly, encouraging purchases.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Provides insight into how sorting affects user behavior, useful for future enhancements.

## 5. test_checkout.py — **Critical Business Flow**
**Rationale**:
Checkout represents the culmination of the shopping journey, directly impacting revenue. This test ensures that the checkout flow—from cart to order completion—is smooth and functional. Automating the checkout process validates that all essential steps are operational, including the entry of customer information and final order confirmation. This high-priority test is essential to mitigate the risk of cart abandonment and lost sales due to checkout issues.

**Impact**:
- **Revenue Protection**: Ensures users can complete purchases without error.
- **User Confidence**: Validates a seamless, frustration-free purchasing experience.
